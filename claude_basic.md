# claude --resume 

● It looks like you're trying to resume a previous Claude Code session, but this is the start of a new conversation. There's no previous session to resume from here.

  If you were working on something specific before, feel free to describe what you'd like to continue working on and I can help you pick up where you left off.

  Based on the git status, I can see you have some work in progress related to:
  - Kafka configuration changes (consumer, producer configs)
  - Delivery guarantees implementation
  - Poison message handling documentation

  Would you like to continue working on any of these?

● The /exactly-once/batch endpoint demonstrates atomic batch message sending with exactly-once semantics using Kafka transactions.

  What it does:
  - Sends multiple messages (default 5) as a single atomic transaction
  - All messages either succeed together or fail together - no partial delivery

  Key code (DeliveryGuaranteeProducerService.java:116-124):
  exactlyOnceTemplate.executeInTransaction(operations -> {
      for (int i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
          String key = keyPrefix + "-" + i;
          String message = "Batch message " + i;
          operations.send(topicName, key, message);
      }
      return true;
  });

  Use case it demonstrates:
  When you need to send multiple related messages that must all succeed or all fail together - for example:
  - A multi-step financial transaction (debit account A, credit account B)
  - Updating multiple related records atomically
  - Event sourcing where multiple events represent one logical operation

  How to test:
  POST /delivery-guarantee/exactly-once/batch?keyPrefix=order123&count=5

  This ensures a consumer with isolation.level=read_committed will only see the messages after the entire batch is committed - they won't see partial results if the transaction fails midway.

# In com.chuwa.demo.service.DeliveryGuaranteeProducerService, only sendBatchExactlyOnce() doesn't use CompletableFuture. What could be the reason? 

● Read(src\main\java\com\chuwa\demo\service\DeliveryGuaranteeProducerService.jav
      a)
  ⎿  Read 132 lines

● Good observation. Looking at the code, there are a few reasons why sendBatchExactlyOnce() skips CompletableFuture handling:

  1. Transaction Provides the Guarantee

  In a transactional batch, the transaction boundary itself is what matters, not individual message acknowledgments:

  // sendBatchExactlyOnce - transaction success/failure is the only thing that matters
  exactlyOnceTemplate.executeInTransaction(operations -> {
      for (int i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
          operations.send(topicName, key, message);  // Just send, don't track
      }
      return true;  // If we reach here, all sends were buffered successfully
  });
  // Transaction commit happens here - ALL or NOTHING

  - If any send fails → transaction aborts → all messages rolled back
  - If transaction commits → all messages guaranteed delivered

  There's no scenario where you need to check individual futures because partial success is impossible.

  2. Contrast with sendExactlyOnce() (single message)

  The single-message version uses CompletableFuture for logging/debugging purposes - to show partition and offset info. But it's arguably unnecessary there too since the transaction handles the guarantee.

  3. Practical Consideration for Batches

  Tracking futures in a batch loop would be cumbersome and add no value:

  // This would be pointless complexity:
  List<CompletableFuture<...>> futures = new ArrayList<>();
  for (int i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
      futures.add(operations.send(...));
  }
  CompletableFuture.allOf(futures).join();  // Why? Transaction handles this

  TL;DR: In transactional batches, the transaction commit/abort is the single source of truth. Individual CompletableFuture tracking is redundant when atomicity is guaranteed at the transaction level.

# So this is just the producer is sending 5 messages within one transaction,
 right? Once sent, they are treated as 5 individual messages by consumers? 

● Yes, exactly right on the producer side. But on the consumer side, it depends on the consumer's isolation.level:

  isolation.level=read_uncommitted (default)

  - Consumer sees messages immediately as they arrive
  - May see partial batches if transaction hasn't committed yet
  - Messages are indeed treated as 5 individual messages

  isolation.level=read_committed

  - Consumer only sees messages after transaction commits
  - Either sees all 5 or none (no partial visibility)
  - But still processes them as 5 individual messages (not a single batch)

  Producer Transaction:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  msg1 → msg2 → msg3 → msg4 → msg5 → COMMIT
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Consumer (read_committed):
    Waits... waits... waits... COMMIT detected!
    → consume msg1
    → consume msg2
    → consume msg3
    → consume msg4
    → consume msg5

  Key Point

  The transaction guarantees atomic visibility, not atomic consumption. The consumer still:
  - Receives them one by one (or in poll batches based on max.poll.records)
  - Commits offsets individually or in batches
  - Can fail mid-way through processing the 5 messages

  If you need the consumer to also process all 5 atomically (consume-transform-produce pattern), you'd need consumer-side transactions as well - which is a different pattern (read-process-write in a transaction).

# For exactly-once delivery guarantee, we need to do following 
configuration: Producer: `enable.idempotence=true`, `transactional.id` set, 
`acks=all`;Consumer: `isolation.level=read_committed`, manual commit, right?
 So is the code '''if (key != null && isDuplicate(key))''' in 
com.chuwa.demo.service.DeliveryGuaranteeConsumerService unnecessary? Since 
the key here is just message key, not idempotent kay. 

● Great question. Let me check that consumer code.

● Read(src\main\java\com\chuwa\demo\service\DeliveryGuaranteeConsumerService.jav
      a)
  ⎿  Read 266 lines

● You're absolutely right to question this! Let me clarify:

  Kafka's Exactly-Once vs Application-Level Idempotency

  Kafka's built-in idempotence (enable.idempotence=true) works at the producer → broker level:
  - Uses Producer ID (PID) + sequence number (assigned automatically by Kafka)
  - Broker deduplicates based on these internal IDs
  - Completely transparent - the message key has nothing to do with it

  So yes, the isDuplicate(key) check using message key is not related to Kafka's idempotence mechanism.

  Why the Code Still Has It (as a placeholder)

  The check exists because Kafka's exactly-once doesn't fully protect the consumer side in all scenarios:

  Consumer:
  1. Reads message (offset 100)
  2. Processes successfully ✓
  3. CRASHES before acknowledgment.acknowledge() ✗
  4. Restarts → re-reads offset 100 → REPROCESSES!

  Kafka's exactly-once guarantees atomic visibility from producer, but the consumer can still reprocess if it crashes after processing but before committing.

  The Code's Problem

  You're correct that it's misleading:

  // Line 174: Using message key as idempotency key - WRONG
  if (key != null && isDuplicate(key)) { ... }

  // Line 202-206: Always returns false anyway!
  private boolean isDuplicate(String idempotencyKey) {
      return false;  // This does nothing
  }

  Issues:
  1. Message key ≠ idempotency key (message key is for partitioning)
  2. A proper idempotency key should be a unique ID per message (e.g., UUID in payload)
  3. The implementation is just a stub that always returns false

  What True Consumer-Side Idempotency Would Look Like

  // In the message payload: {"idempotencyId": "uuid-123", "data": "..."}
  if (redis.exists("processed:" + message.getIdempotencyId())) {
      return; // Already processed
  }
  processMessage(message);
  redis.set("processed:" + message.getIdempotencyId(), "1", TTL);
  acknowledgment.acknowledge();

  TL;DR: You're correct. The isDuplicate(key) code conflates message key with idempotency key and is just a non-functional placeholder demonstrating where application-level deduplication would go.

# Is Dead Letter Queue in consumeAtLeastOnce() real? It just calls 
"sendToDeadLetterQueue()" which just System.err.println() some error 
messages. The overcome of "poison pill" seems done by field Map<String, 
Integer> retryAttempts. 

● You're absolutely right. Let me break down what's real vs. placeholder:

  What's Real (Poison Pill Handling)

  The retry tracking mechanism works:

  // Line 26-27: In-memory retry tracking
  private final Map<String, Integer> retryAttempts = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
  private static final int MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;

  // Line 90: Track by partition-offset
  String offsetKey = partition + "-" + offset;

  // Line 93-94: Increment attempt count
  int attemptNumber = retryAttempts.getOrDefault(offsetKey, 0) + 1;
  retryAttempts.put(offsetKey, attemptNumber);

  // Line 121-133: After max retries, commit offset to skip the poison message
  if (attemptNumber >= MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS) {
      sendToDeadLetterQueue(...);  // Just logging
      acknowledgment.acknowledge(); // THIS is what skips the poison pill
      retryAttempts.remove(offsetKey);
  }

  The actual poison pill resolution is acknowledgment.acknowledge() - committing the offset to move past the bad message.

  What's Fake (DLQ)

  // Lines 224-241: Just prints to console
  private void sendToDeadLetterQueue(...) {
      System.err.println("========== DEAD LETTER QUEUE ==========");
      System.err.println(...);
      // Comments say what SHOULD happen in production
  }

  No actual Kafka topic, no persistence.

  Problems with Current Implementation

  1. In-memory tracking - If app restarts, retryAttempts is lost → retry count resets
  2. No actual DLQ - Failed messages are logged and discarded, not stored for replay
  3. Race conditions - Multiple consumers/partitions could have issues with shared map

  What a Real DLQ Would Look Like

  @Autowired
  private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

  private void sendToDeadLetterQueue(String key, String message, Exception e) {
      // Actually send to a DLQ topic
      kafkaTemplate.send("my-topic-dlq", key, message);
  }

  TL;DR: You're correct. The DLQ is just logging. The poison pill handling is real but fragile (in-memory retry tracking + offset commit to skip).

# Explain why sending messages to "/exactly-once/batch" and "/exactly-once" would always have one consumer lag on the at-least-once consumer and the at-most-once consumer? 

● Let me check the consumer configuration to explain this.

● Read(src\main\java\com\chuwa\demo\config\KafkaDeliveryGuaranteeConfig.java)
  ⎿  Read 207 lines

● Now I can explain the lag. The key is in transaction control records.

  The Cause: Transaction Markers

  When the exactly-once producer commits a transaction, Kafka writes control records (COMMIT markers) to the log. These occupy offsets but are not consumable messages.

  Topic Log after sending 1 message via /exactly-once:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ Offset 0: Message "hello"                           │
  │ Offset 1: COMMIT marker (control record)  ← Not a message!
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  Log End Offset = 2

  Different Consumer Behaviors

  at-most-once and at-least-once consumers (lines 58-71, 111-124):
  - No isolation.level set → defaults to read_uncommitted
  - They consume the message at offset 0
  - They commit offset 1
  - But offset 1 is a control record they can't consume
  - Lag calculation: Log End Offset (2) - Consumer Position (1) = 1
  - Perpetual lag of 1 that can never be resolved

  exactly-once consumer (line 189):
  - isolation.level=read_committed
  - Control records are transparently filtered out
  - Lag calculation properly excludes control records
  - No phantom lag

  Visual Example

  Send 5 messages via /exactly-once/batch:

  Log:  [msg1][msg2][msg3][msg4][msg5][COMMIT]
         0     1     2     3     4      5

  read_uncommitted consumer:
    - Consumes offsets 0-4 (5 messages)
    - Position: 5
    - Log End: 6
    - Lag: 1  ← The COMMIT marker it can't consume

  read_committed consumer:
    - Consumes offsets 0-4 (5 messages)
    - Lag: 0  ← COMMIT marker excluded from calculation

  TL;DR: The lag of 1 is caused by the transaction COMMIT marker. read_uncommitted consumers see it in lag calculations but can never consume it. read_committed consumers filter it out automatically.

# In consumer side idempotency protection, you mentioned "if (redis.exists("processed:" + message.getIdempotencyId()))", can idempotent key be accessed by consumers? 

● Great question. Let me clarify the two different "idempotency keys":

  Kafka's Internal Idempotency Key (NOT accessible)

  Producer ID (PID) + Sequence Number

  - Assigned automatically by Kafka broker when enable.idempotence=true
  - Used internally for producer → broker deduplication
  - NOT exposed to consumers - completely transparent

  Application-Level Idempotency Key (YOU must provide it)

  This must be embedded in the message payload by the producer:

  // Producer side - include idempotency key in message
  public class OrderEvent {
      private String idempotencyId;  // UUID generated by producer
      private String orderId;
      private BigDecimal amount;
      // ...
  }

  // When sending:
  OrderEvent event = new OrderEvent();
  event.setIdempotencyId(UUID.randomUUID().toString());  // YOU generate this
  event.setOrderId("12345");
  kafkaTemplate.send("orders", event);

  // Consumer side - extract from payload
  @KafkaListener(topics = "orders")
  public void consume(OrderEvent event) {
      String idempotencyId = event.getIdempotencyId();  // From message payload

      if (redis.exists("processed:" + idempotencyId)) {
          return;  // Already processed
      }
    
      processOrder(event);
      redis.set("processed:" + idempotencyId, "1", Duration.ofDays(7));
  }

  Summary

  | Idempotency Type | Who Creates It | Consumer Access     | Purpose               |
  |------------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
  | Kafka's PID+Seq  | Kafka broker   | ❌ No               | Producer→Broker dedup |
  | Application ID   | Your code      | ✅ Yes (in payload) | Consumer-side dedup   |

  TL;DR: Kafka's internal idempotency key is invisible to consumers. For consumer-side deduplication, you must generate your own unique ID and include it in the message payload.
  
  
  
# In com.chuwa.demo.config.KafkaDeliveryGuaranteeConfig line 189, only exactly-once consumer has isolation.level=read_committed", but the UI for Apache Kafka shows that at-least-once consumer and exactly once consumer would     
have 1 consumer lag. At-most-once consumer would move the offset by the COMMIT marker. Is this normal? Is that COMMIT marker comes from exactlyOnceTemplate.executeInTransaction in 
com.chuwa.demo.service.DeliveryGuaranteeProducerService? 

● Interesting observation! Let me analyze this more carefully.

  Your Observation

  | Consumer      | isolation.level            | Commit Mode | Lag |
  |---------------|----------------------------|-------------|-----|
  | at-most-once  | read_uncommitted (default) | Auto-commit | 0   |
  | at-least-once | read_uncommitted (default) | Manual      | 1   |
  | exactly-once  | read_committed             | Manual      | 1   |

  Explanation

  The difference is auto-commit vs manual commit, not the isolation level.

  Auto-commit (at-most-once):
  props.put(ConsumerConfig.ENABLE_AUTO_COMMIT_CONFIG, true);  // Line 66
  - Auto-commit commits based on the consumer's internal position
  - After polling, the consumer position advances past control records automatically
  - Auto-commit then commits this advanced position (past the COMMIT marker)
  - Result: No lag

  Manual commit (at-least-once, exactly-once):
  acknowledgment.acknowledge();  // Commits current_offset + 1
  - If message is at offset 0, this commits offset 1
  - But COMMIT marker is at offset 1, log end is at offset 2
  - Lag = Log End (2) - Committed Offset (1) = 1
  - The consumer skips control records when polling, but manual acknowledge doesn't advance past them

  Log:  [Message @ 0] [COMMIT marker @ 1]  → Log End = 2

  Auto-commit:     commits position 2 → Lag = 0
  Manual commit:   commits offset 1   → Lag = 1

  Yes, the COMMIT Marker Comes from executeInTransaction

  // DeliveryGuaranteeProducerService.java
  exactlyOnceTemplate.executeInTransaction(operations -> {
      operations.send(topicName, key, message);
      return true;
  });  // ← Transaction COMMIT marker written here

  When executeInTransaction completes successfully, Kafka writes a COMMIT control record to the log.

  Is This Normal?

  Yes, this is expected behavior. The lag of 1 for manual-commit consumers is a "phantom lag" - there's no actual message to consume, just a control record the consumer can't process. It's cosmetic and doesn't indicate a real problem.

  If you want manual-commit consumers to also show 0 lag, you'd need to trigger another poll cycle after the last message to advance the position past control records, but this isn't necessary for correctness.



# My message isn't be distributed to each partition in a round-robun way when without a partition key. 

● This is expected behavior in modern Kafka. Since Kafka 2.4+, the default partitioner changed from round-robin to sticky partitioning for messages with null keys.

  Sticky Partitioning (Default Since Kafka 2.4)

  When key is null:
  - Messages are sent to one partition until the batch is full or linger.ms expires
  - Then switches to another partition
  - Purpose: Better batching efficiency and reduced latency

  Old behavior (pre-2.4):  msg1→P0, msg2→P1, msg3→P2, msg4→P0 ...
  New behavior (2.4+):     msg1→P0, msg2→P0, msg3→P0, msg4→P1 ... (sticky)

  Why You See This

  If you send messages quickly (e.g., via API calls in rapid succession), they likely all land in the same batch → same partition.

  If You Want True Round-Robin

  You have a few options:

  Option 1: Use a round-robin key
  AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

  public void send(String message) {
      String key = String.valueOf(counter.getAndIncrement() % numPartitions);
      kafkaTemplate.send(topic, key, message);
  }

  Option 2: Custom partitioner
  props.put(ProducerConfig.PARTITIONER_CLASS_CONFIG, RoundRobinPartitioner.class);

  Option 3: Increase linger.ms awareness
  - With very small linger.ms (default 0), each send might create its own batch
  - But with connection reuse, sticky partitioning still applies within a time window

  To Verify

  Check your Kafka/Spring Kafka version - if it's 2.4+, sticky partitioning is the default. This is intentional for performance, not a bug.

> Option 2: Custom partitioner
  props.put(ProducerConfig.PARTITIONER_CLASS_CONFIG, RoundRobinPartitioner.class);
# How to write my own partitioning logic or use round Robin? 

● Here are both approaches:

  Option 1: Use Kafka's Built-in RoundRobinPartitioner

  Kafka provides RoundRobinPartitioner out of the box (since 2.4):

```java
  import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.RoundRobinPartitioner;

  // In your producer config
  props.put(ProducerConfig.PARTITIONER_CLASS_CONFIG, RoundRobinPartitioner.class);

  In your KafkaDeliveryGuaranteeConfig.java, for example:

  @Bean
  public ProducerFactory<String, String> atLeastOnceProducerFactory() {
      Map<String, Object> props = new HashMap<>();
      props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, bootstrapServers);
      props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);
      props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class);

      // Add round-robin partitioner
      props.put(ProducerConfig.PARTITIONER_CLASS_CONFIG, RoundRobinPartitioner.class);

      // ... other configs
      return new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory<>(props);
  }
```
  Option 2: Write Your Own Custom Partitioner
```java
  package com.chuwa.demo.config;

  import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Partitioner;
  import org.apache.kafka.common.Cluster;

  import java.util.Map;
  import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

  public class CustomRoundRobinPartitioner implements Partitioner {

      private final AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

      @Override
      public int partition(String topic, Object key, byte[] keyBytes,
                           Object value, byte[] valueBytes, Cluster cluster) {

          int numPartitions = cluster.partitionCountForTopic(topic);

          // If key is provided, use default key-based partitioning
          if (keyBytes != null) {
              return Math.abs(key.hashCode()) % numPartitions;
          }

          // For null keys, use round-robin
          return Math.abs(counter.getAndIncrement()) % numPartitions;
      }

      @Override
      public void close() {
          // Cleanup if needed
      }

      @Override
      public void configure(Map<String, ?> configs) {
          // Read custom configs if needed
          // e.g., configs.get("custom.partitioner.some-setting")
      }
  }
```
  Then use it:

  props.put(ProducerConfig.PARTITIONER_CLASS_CONFIG, CustomRoundRobinPartitioner.class);

  Option 3: Custom Logic Examples

  By message content (e.g., priority):
  
  ```java
  @Override
  public int partition(String topic, Object key, byte[] keyBytes,
                       Object value, byte[] valueBytes, Cluster cluster) {

      int numPartitions = cluster.partitionCountForTopic(topic);
      String message = new String(valueBytes);

      // High priority messages go to partition 0
      if (message.contains("URGENT")) {
          return 0;
      }

      // Others distributed by hash
      return Math.abs(message.hashCode()) % numPartitions;
  }
  ```

  By time-based sharding:
  ```java
  @Override
  public int partition(String topic, Object key, byte[] keyBytes,
                       Object value, byte[] valueBytes, Cluster cluster) {

      int numPartitions = cluster.partitionCountForTopic(topic);
      int hour = LocalDateTime.now().getHour();

      // Distribute by hour of day
      return hour % numPartitions;
  }
  ```

  Summary

  | Approach              | Use Case                                            |
  |-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
  | RoundRobinPartitioner | Simple round-robin, no custom logic needed          |
  | Custom partitioner    | Need business logic (priority, time, content-based) |
  | Key-based (default)   | Want related messages in same partition             |

  For most cases, the built-in RoundRobinPartitioner is sufficient if you just want even distribution without keys.


# I added custom partitioner in com.chuwa.demo.config.KafkaProducerConfig line 28 and added file com.chuwa.demo.config.CustomRoundRobinPartitioner, but the messages without specifying message key still go to the same partition. 

● Read(src\main\java\com\chuwa\demo\config\KafkaProducerConfig.java)
  ⎿  Read 47 lines

● Read(src\main\java\com\chuwa\demo\config\CustomRoundRobinPartitioner.java)
  ⎿  Read 42 lines

● I see the issue. The custom partitioner is only configured in KafkaProducerConfig, but you have multiple KafkaTemplates in your application.

  Looking at KafkaDeliveryGuaranteeConfig.java, it defines separate producer factories that don't include your custom partitioner:

  - atMostOnceKafkaTemplate → atMostOnceProducerFactory() → No custom partitioner
  - atLeastOnceKafkaTemplate → atLeastOnceProducerFactory() → No custom partitioner
  - exactlyOnceKafkaTemplate → exactlyOnceProducerFactory() → No custom partitioner

  Only the kafkaTemplate from KafkaProducerConfig has your custom partitioner.

  Which endpoint are you using?

  Let me check the controller to confirm which template is used.

● Found the issue. The DeliveryGuaranteeController uses DeliveryGuaranteeProducerService, which injects:

  - atMostOnceKafkaTemplate
  - atLeastOnceKafkaTemplate
  - exactlyOnceKafkaTemplate

  These are all from KafkaDeliveryGuaranteeConfig.java, which don't have your custom partitioner.

  The kafkaTemplate with your custom partitioner isn't being used anywhere.

  Solution

  Add the custom partitioner to the producer factories in KafkaDeliveryGuaranteeConfig.java:

  // Line 46 - in atMostOnceProducerFactory()
  props.put(ProducerConfig.PARTITIONER_CLASS_CONFIG, CustomRoundRobinPartitioner.class);

  // Line 98 - in atLeastOnceProducerFactory()
  props.put(ProducerConfig.PARTITIONER_CLASS_CONFIG, CustomRoundRobinPartitioner.class);

  // Line 168 - in exactlyOnceProducerFactory()
  props.put(ProducerConfig.PARTITIONER_CLASS_CONFIG, CustomRoundRobinPartitioner.class);

  Or if you want me to make the edits for you, let me know which producer(s) you want to add it to.

  Quick Verification

  Is the System.out.println("Key by custom partitioner: "+res) in your partitioner even being printed? If not, it confirms the partitioner isn't being used at all.

# Why the message in my partitioner would be printed twice each time I send a message? like: 

● This is likely happening for one of these reasons:

  Most Likely: Multiple Consumers = Multiple Consumer Groups

  You have 3 consumer groups all listening to the same topic:
  - at-most-once-group
  - at-least-once-group
  - exactly-once-group

  But wait, the partitioner is on the producer side, not consumer...

  More Likely Causes:

  1. You added the partitioner to multiple producer factories?

  If you added CustomRoundRobinPartitioner to both KafkaProducerConfig and one of the factories in KafkaDeliveryGuaranteeConfig, and both templates are somehow being invoked.

  2. Spring Kafka calls partitioner twice internally

  This can happen when:
  - KafkaTemplate.send() calls partitioner to determine partition
  - The underlying Kafka producer calls it again when actually sending

  3. Two producer instances created

  Each producer instance creates its own Partitioner instance. The counter is per-instance, not shared.

  Can you share the exact output?

  For example, does it look like:
  Key by custom partitioner: 0
  Key by custom partitioner: 0
  (Same value = same partitioner instance called twice)

  Or:
  Key by custom partitioner: 0
  Key by custom partitioner: 1
  (Different values = two different partitioner instances with separate counters)

  This will help identify whether it's the same partitioner called twice or two different partitioner instances.

# Yes. The logging is like:
Key by custom partitioner: 0
Key by custom partitioner: 1
Next message:
Key by custom partitioner: 2
Key by custom partitioner: 0
Next message:
Key by custom partitioner: 1
Key by custom partitioner: 2 

● This confirms a single partitioner instance being called twice per message.

  Look at the counter progression:
  Message 1: 0, 1     → counter: 0→1→2
  Message 2: 2, 0     → counter: 2→3 (3%3=0)→4
  Message 3: 1, 2     → counter: 4%3=1→5%3=2→6

  The counter is incrementing twice per send, meaning the partition() method is invoked twice for each message.

  Why This Happens

  Spring Kafka / Kafka Producer can call the partitioner twice:

  1. First call: When KafkaTemplate.send() creates the ProducerRecord and needs to determine the partition for batching/routing
  2. Second call: When the record is actually dispatched to the broker

  The second value is the actual partition the message goes to.

  The Impact

  Your messages actually go to partitions: 1, 0, 2 (the second value each time) - which IS round-robin, just with confusing logs.

  Fix: Avoid Double-Counting

  If you want cleaner behavior, you can specify the partition explicitly in the ProducerRecord so the partitioner isn't called twice:

  Option 1: Cache the partition result
  public class CustomRoundRobinPartitioner implements Partitioner {

      private final AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
      private final ThreadLocal<Integer> lastPartition = new ThreadLocal<>();

      @Override
      public int partition(String topic, Object key, byte[] keyBytes,
                           Object value, byte[] valueBytes, Cluster cluster) {

          int numPartitions = cluster.partitionCountForTopic(topic);

          if (keyBytes != null) {
              return Math.abs(key.hashCode()) % numPartitions;
          }

          // Only increment on first call per thread context
          int partition = counter.getAndIncrement() % numPartitions;
          System.out.println("Key by custom partitioner: " + partition);
          return partition;
      }
      // ...
  }

  Option 2: Just accept it - The actual distribution IS round-robin, just the logging shows both calls.

  Would you like me to update the partitioner to avoid the double-increment issue?

# When I sent messages to API POST "localhost:8088/delivery-guarantee/at-most-once?message=test4&Key=1" and POST "http://localhost:8088/delivery-guarantee/at-least-once?Key=12345&message=fixed", Why the "Key" in logging and UI for Apache Kafka is always null? 

● Let me check the controller to see how the key parameter is defined.

● Read(src\main\java\com\chuwa\demo\controller\DeliveryGuaranteeController.java)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

● Found it! Query parameters are case-sensitive.

  The controller expects lowercase key:
  @RequestParam(value = "key", required = false) String key  // lowercase "key"

  But you're passing uppercase Key:
  ?message=test4&Key=1        ← uppercase K
  ?Key=12345&message=fixed    ← uppercase K

  Solution

  Use lowercase key:
  POST localhost:8088/delivery-guarantee/at-most-once?message=test4&key=1
  POST http://localhost:8088/delivery-guarantee/at-least-once?key=12345&message=fixed

  Key ≠ key in query parameters.

# In the " Option 1: Cache the partition result" you mentioned in the previous question can you provide the complete implementation if not too complicated? the "ThreadLocal<Integer> lastPartition" field in your provided code is never used. 

● You're right, I left that incomplete. Here's the corrected full implementation:

  package com.chuwa.demo.config;

  import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Partitioner;
  import org.apache.kafka.common.Cluster;

  import java.util.Arrays;
  import java.util.Map;
  import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

  public class CustomRoundRobinPartitioner implements Partitioner {

      private final AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

      // Cache to detect duplicate calls for the same message
      private final ThreadLocal<CachedPartition> cache = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> null);

      private static class CachedPartition {
          final String topic;
          final byte[] valueBytes;
          final int partition;

          CachedPartition(String topic, byte[] valueBytes, int partition) {
              this.topic = topic;
              this.valueBytes = valueBytes;
              this.partition = partition;
          }
      }

      @Override
      public int partition(String topic, Object key, byte[] keyBytes,
                           Object value, byte[] valueBytes, Cluster cluster) {

          int numPartitions = cluster.partitionCountForTopic(topic);

          // If key is provided, use key-based partitioning
          if (keyBytes != null) {
              return Math.abs(key.hashCode()) % numPartitions;
          }

          // Check if this is a duplicate call for the same message
          CachedPartition cached = cache.get();
          if (cached != null
                  && cached.topic.equals(topic)
                  && Arrays.equals(cached.valueBytes, valueBytes)) {
              // Same message, return cached partition (no increment)
              System.out.println("Custom partitioner (cached): " + cached.partition);
              return cached.partition;
          }

          // New message, compute partition using round-robin
          int partition = Math.abs(counter.getAndIncrement()) % numPartitions;

          // Cache the result for potential duplicate call
          cache.set(new CachedPartition(topic, valueBytes, partition));

          System.out.println("Custom partitioner (new): " + partition);
          return partition;
      }

      @Override
      public void close() {
          cache.remove();
      }

      @Override
      public void configure(Map<String, ?> configs) {
          // No custom config needed
      }
  }

  How It Works

  1. First call for a message: Computes partition, caches (topic, valueBytes, partition)
  2. Second call for same message: Detects duplicate via Arrays.equals(valueBytes), returns cached partition without incrementing counter

  Expected Output Now

  Message 1:
  Custom partitioner (new): 0
  Custom partitioner (cached): 0    ← Same partition, no increment

  Message 2:
  Custom partitioner (new): 1
  Custom partitioner (cached): 1

  Message 3:
  Custom partitioner (new): 2
  Custom partitioner (cached): 2

  Caveat

  If you send two identical messages in a row (same content), the second message might get the cached partition instead of a new one. If that's a concern, you could add a timestamp or use a different caching strategy.

# Yes, it worked. Now each message would have the same partition key for the 2 invoke, like:
Custom partitioner (new): 2
Custom partitioner (cached): 2
How does it worked? Is it because each time a message is sent, there would be a new thread created (or from a thread pool) to handle the partitioning, and the 2 invoke of partition() belongs to the same thread? So the 
ThreadLocal<CachedPartition> cache will never be seen by other thread? 

● Great question! Let me clarify how it actually works:

  Not New Threads - Same Thread, Same Send Operation

  It's not about new threads being created for each message. Both partition() calls happen on the same thread during a single kafkaTemplate.send() call:

  Thread-1 calls kafkaTemplate.send(topic, key, message)
  │
  ├─► partition() called FIRST time (e.g., during record preparation)
  │   └─► Cache miss → compute partition 2, store in ThreadLocal
  │
  ├─► partition() called SECOND time (e.g., during actual dispatch)
  │   └─► Cache hit (same thread, same valueBytes) → return cached 2
  │
  └─► send() returns

  Both calls happen synchronously within the same send() invocation, on the same thread.

  How ThreadLocal Works Here

  Thread-1: sends "messageA"
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ ThreadLocal cache for Thread-1:         │
  │   topic="my-topic", valueBytes="msgA"   │
  │   partition=2                           │
  │                                         │
  │ 1st call: cache miss → compute & store  │
  │ 2nd call: cache hit → return stored     │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Thread-2: sends "messageB" (concurrently)
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ ThreadLocal cache for Thread-2:         │
  │   (completely separate storage)         │
  │   topic="my-topic", valueBytes="msgB"   │
  │   partition=3                           │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Why It Works

  | Scenario                            | What Happens                                                      |
  |-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Same message, 2nd call              | Same thread + same valueBytes → cache hit                         |
  | Different message, same thread      | Same thread but different valueBytes → cache miss → new partition |
  | Different message, different thread | Different thread → different ThreadLocal → cache miss             |

  Key Point

  ThreadLocal ensures:
  1. Thread isolation - Thread-1's cache is invisible to Thread-2
  2. Same-thread sharing - Both partition() calls within one send() see the same cache

  So yes, your understanding is correct: the two invocations belong to the same thread, and ThreadLocal ensures other threads never see this thread's cached value.
